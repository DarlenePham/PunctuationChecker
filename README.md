*Comma:
- Fix the comma to be in right position.
- Add a comma before the word "and" if the sentence is a list with longer than 2 objects.
- Example: 
 + I live with my sisters,brothers and our parents at California. => I live with my sisters, brothers, and our parents at California.
 + My favorite food is pizza and chicken. => My favorite food is pizza and chicken. (doesn't change because comma is unnecessary)
